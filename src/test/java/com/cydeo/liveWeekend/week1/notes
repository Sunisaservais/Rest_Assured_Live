--- (Stage-1) We have already handled until now with theoretical part.

--- (Stage-2) The steps for doing API Test Automation
        1. Understand Requirements
        2. Read API Documentation:
                Base URL and Endpoints
                Parameters:
                       Path Parameters
                       Query Parameters
                Headers (Metadata):
                        Request Headers
                        Response Headers
                Status Codes
        3. Perform Manual Testing
        4. Begin Automation for API Testing --> Rest Assured Library
                (Automation for UI Testing) --> Selenium
                (Automation for DB Testing) --> JDBC
